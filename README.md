# Project-TCP-IP
This project is for practicing to write **server program in Go language**.
(The program is now on refactoring stage.)

This is based on Java program that I made when I was at university in 2013 Summer.

## Client program
Function of the client program
  - Chatting (with other clients)
  - Othello game (with another client)
  
## Server program
The server runs for delivering the messages between clients.

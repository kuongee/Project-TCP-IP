# Project-TCP-IP
This project is for practicing to write **server program in Go language**.
(The program is now on refactoring stage.)

This is based on one of my program that I made when I was at university in Jan, 2014.

## Server program
The server runs for delivering the messages between clients.

## Client program
written in Java

What clients can do:
  - Chatting (with other clients)
  - Othello game (with another client)
